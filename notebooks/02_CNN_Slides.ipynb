    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Training a Dog\n",
    "Imagine you're training a dog to sit:\n",
    "- When the dog sits perfectly → You give lots of treats (low loss)\n",
    "- When the dog doesn't sit → No treats (high loss)\n",
    "- When the dog partially sits → Some treats (medium loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In CNN Terms:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example with numbers\n",
    "perfect_prediction = 0.95    # Model is 95% sure it's a cat, and it is a cat\n",
    "okay_prediction = 0.70       # Model is 70% sure it's a cat, and it is a cat\n",
    "bad_prediction = 0.20        # Model is only 20% sure it's a cat, and it is a cat\n",

    "perfect_loss = -log(0.95) = 0.051    # Very small loss (good!)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Kernels and Convolutions: The Magic of Pattern Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think of Kernels Like Instagram Filters!\n",
    "Just like how Instagram filters change how your photos look:\n",
    "- Some filters make edges stand out\n",
    "- Some make colors brighter\n",
    "- Some make the image blurry\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNNs, kernels are like these filters, but they're designed to find specific patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Edge Detection Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "edge_detection = [\n",
    "    [-1, -1, -1],\n",
    "    [-1,  8, -1],\n",
    "    [-1, -1, -1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When this kernel slides over an image:\n",
    "- It highlights edges\n",
    "- Makes flat areas disappear\n",
    "- Helps the CNN understand shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does It Work? Let's Break It Down:\n",
    "1. Take a small part of your image (say 3x3 pixels)\n",
    "2. Multiply each pixel with the corresponding kernel number\n",
    "3. Add all the results\n",
    "4. That's your new pixel value!\n"

    "## Pooling Layers: Making Images Smaller and Smarter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think of Pooling Like Summarizing a Picture\n",
    "Imagine you have a big photo and want to make it smaller while keeping the important parts:\n",
    "- Max Pooling: Keep the brightest/strongest part\n",
    "- Average Pooling: Take the average of all parts\n",

    "Original Image Section:\n",
    "\n",
    "[[ 1,  2,  3,  4],\n",
    " [ 5,  6,  7,  8],\n",

    "\n",
    "[[ 6,  8],\n",
    " [14, 16]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Use Pooling?\n",
    "1. **Reduces Size**: Makes the image smaller, so computations are faster\n",
    "2. **Keeps Important Features**: Like keeping the strongest edges or patterns\n",
    "3. **Makes the Network More Robust**: Small changes in the image position don't matter as much\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create another Markdown cell for the non-linearity section:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-linearity: Adding the Power to Learn Complex Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Non-linearity?\n",
    "Imagine trying to draw a circle using only straight lines:\n",
    "- With only straight lines (linear): 🔷 Best you can do is a polygon\n",
    "- With curves (non-linear): ⭕ You can make a perfect circle\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU: The Most Popular Non-linear Function\n",
    "ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is like a bouncer at a club:\n",
    "- If the number is positive: \"Come on in!\" (keeps the value)\n",
    "- If the number is negative: \"Sorry, not today!\" (changes it to zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def relu(x):\n",
    "    return max(0, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "input_value = 5    # Output: 5 (positive, so keep it)\n",
    "input_value = -3   # Output: 0 (negative, so make it zero)\n",
    "input_value = 0    # Output: 0 (zero stays zero)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ReLU Works So Well:\n",
    "1. **Simple to Understand**: Just \"if negative, make zero\"\n",
    "2. **Fast to Calculate**: Just a simple check and operation\n",
    "3. **Helps Networks Learn**: Creates clear paths for learning patterns\n"
